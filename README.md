# Selenium Manager Artifacts

* This repository is not intended for public consumption
* Selenium is released with Selenium Manager built in. Read our documentation on [Selenium Manager](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/selenium_manager/)
* This repo exists so the Selenium build system can access binaries built by GitHub Actions, because Rust cannot cross compile the way we need it to
* This will also maintain a history of releases including the debug releases in case we need to troubleshoot an issue
