# Selenium Manager Artifacts

* This repository is not intended for public consumption
* Selenium is released with Selenium Manager built-in; read our documentation on [Selenium Manager](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/selenium_manager/) for more details.
* This repo exists so the Selenium build system can access binaries built by GitHub Actions, because Rust cannot cross compile the way we need it to
* This will also store historical builds including the debug builds in case we need to troubleshoot an issue
